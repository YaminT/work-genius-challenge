## Requirements

- System has users
- Users to create teams
- A team consist of name and description properties

## API requirements

## Tech requirements

Your solution should be written using libraries/frameworks from the list below

### web frameworks of choice:
- [falcon](https://falcon.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- [fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/lo/)
- [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/)

### orm:
- [sqlalchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/tutorial/index.html#unified-tutorial)

### validation/serialization:
- [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/)

### databases of choice:
- postgresql
- redis

## What will be evaluated

- How well the code provided accomplishes/satisfies functional requirements
- How easy is to read/understand the code
- How well the code is organized
- How well different abstraction layers are isolated
- How well the libraries/frameworks were used
- How well main use-cases are tested
- How well latest python language features are used/incorporated
- How easy is to setup & run the project

## Results

A github link with accomplished exercise and instructions on how to run the project are expected to be sent via email. Private repo also fine, in this case don't forget to add `ivan@workgenius.com` to contributors.

> if github link is not an option for you, a zip archive of the project can be sent

Good luck ;)
